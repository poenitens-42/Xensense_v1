XENSENSE-V1 (Paper implementation) 

A video object segmentation and labelling model for autonomous vehicles

Hi This is my project xensensev1 

I am currently using python 3.10.11 as most of the librairies used 
for this tends to break/mis-match with other dependent librairies 

So far we have covered object classification, 


-Future cases to implement 
        -STM
        -Partial occlusion 
        -
